## Overview

This project focuses on identifying and visualizing the top 10 most used bike routes in the city of Los Angeles from the Metro Bike Share program. The analysis covers bike trips taken between April 2022 and June 2022, totaling approximately sixty-seven thousand trips. To enhance clarity, short round trips have been excluded from the analysis, allowing for a better understanding of origin and destination trips throughout the city.

## Spatial Distribution

When observing the spatial distribution of bike trips, it becomes evident that the majority of bike rides are concentrated on the West Coast of Los Angeles, particularly around Venice Beach. This concentration aligns with Los Angeles' tourist attractions and geography, making it a hotspot for bike enthusiasts. The Venice Beach area is densely populated and home to popular destinations like the beach itself and the Santa Monica pier.

## Interactive Plot

To address the issue of route overlaps in this highly concentrated area, an interactive plot has been created. This plot allows users to select and interact with individual routes by toggling them in the legend. This feature enables exploration of the routes without overlapping, enhancing the user's experience.

## Top 10 Bike Routes

1. **Route 1 (Red)**: This short route spans from the edge of the beach to the center of Venice Beach, making it the most frequently used. With only one station along this stretch, it's a convenient choice for users visiting the heart of the beach.

2. **Route 2 (Orange)**: A longer route that runs the full length of the beach, ideal for users looking to explore the entire shoreline. It allows riders to conveniently drop off their bikes at the end-of-the-beach station and continue their journey by other means.

3. **Route 3 (Yellow)**: Similar to Route 1 but in the opposite direction, accommodating users returning from the middle of the beach to the exit.

4. **Remaining Top 10 Routes**: The remaining top 10 routes are also centered around the Venice Beach area, emphasizing the high demand for Metro Bikes in this location.

## Exploring New Areas

The tenth most popular bike route, located in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, marks the first route outside the Venice Beach area. Playa Vista is a residential area and presents an opportunity for the Metro Bike Share organization to explore and expand their services.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the significance of providing ample bike accessibility in areas with favorable climates, tourist hotspots, or high foot traffic. In a sprawling city like Los Angeles, where public transport and biking are essential modes of transportation, catering to both tourists and locals in such locations is crucial. The concentration of bike trips in certain areas underscores the need for convenient bike-sharing services, particularly in tourist destinations. 

Ultimately, this project sheds light on the patterns of bike usage in Los Angeles, reinforcing the idea that accessibility to bikes in the right locations can greatly benefit both residents and visitors, providing an eco-friendly and efficient mode of transportation in a city known for its size and reliance on cars.
